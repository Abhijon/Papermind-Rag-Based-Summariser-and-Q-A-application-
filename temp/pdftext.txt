                                                      ABSTRACT 
 
This project is a comprehensive online job portal developed to streamline, simplify, and 
automate the end-to-end recruitment process. It enables recruiters to register, post job 
vacancies, and assess potential candidates through built-in online assessments tailored to each 
role. Candidates can create profiles, browse job openings, apply to positions, and take 
relevant tests directly on the platform. Based on the candidate’s performance in these 
assessments, recruiters can make informed hiring decisions. The system automatically sends 
real-time email notifications to candidates regarding their selection or rejection, ensuring 
clear and prompt communication. To maintain security and usability, the platform 
incorporates role-based access control, ensuring separate functionalities and dashboards for 
recruiters and applicants. Additionally, the portal is designed for user-friendliness, scalability, 
and efficient data management. By automating crucial steps like application review and 
communication, this system bridges the gap between skilled candidates and employers, 
making the recruitment journey faster, more transparent, and highly effective for both parties.

                                                            INTRODUCTION  
1.1  A Brief Introduction to Skill Sphere(E-Job Portal) 
The Skill Sphere(E-Job Portal System) has been developed to overcome the limitations of 
traditional recruitment methods. This software aims to simplify and automate the hiring 
process by providing a digital platform where recruiters can post job openings, conduct skill-
based assessments, and make informed hiring decisions. It also facilitates candidates in 
applying for jobs, completing assessments, and receiving real-time updates about their 
application status via email. 
System Features: 
 
Provides real-time email notifications to candidates based on assessment results. 
 
Supports job posting, application tracking, and assessment management for recruiters. 
 
Displays detailed job descriptions, requirements, and company information for 
applicants. 
 
Implements role-based access for recruiters and candidates. 
 
Automates communication between recruiters and candidates. 
 
Enables performance-based filtering to support skill-based hiring. 
 
Ensures secure handling of user data and assessment scores. 
Modules in the Job Portal System:

decisions. 

8 
 
 
Email Notification Module: Sends real-time emails to candidates based on selection 
or rejection. 
 
Login & Authentication Module: Secures access using role-based login with 
encrypted credentials 
1.2  Reason behind the Usage of Skill Sphere(An E-Job Portal) 
The main objective of the Skill Sphere(E-Job System) is to manage the complete lifecycle 
of recruitment, including details of Recruiters, Candidates, Job Postings, Applications, 
Assessments, and Real-Time Notifications. It centralizes all the information related to job 
opportunities, candidate applications, recruiter actions, and assessment outcomes. The system 
is primarily designed for the administrative end, where recruiters and candidates have 
separate roles with specific access. The main purpose of this project is to eliminate manual 
tasks involved in traditional hiring, such as resume filtering, email communication, and 
scheduling, by automating them through a single web-based platform. It tracks all essential 
information including job descriptions, applicant performance, application status, and 
recruiter decisions. The goal of the Job Portal System is to digitally transform the manual 
recruitment process with the help of modern web technologies and real-time tools, ensuring 
data is secure, easily accessible, and efficiently managed over time. The system is built using 
the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)—which is open-source, 
widely supported, and developer-friendly. Both software and hardware requirements are 
minimal, making the system cost-effective, scalable. 
1.3  Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Of the System 
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is prepared after the completion of the 
system analysis phase. It defines the functional and non-functional requirements allocated to 
the software during system engineering. It includes a complete description of the system’s 
information flow, functionalities, performance expectations, design limitations, and 
validation criteria necessary for successful implementation. 
The proposed Online Job Portal System has the following key software requirements: 
 
The system must store information about newly registered Recruiters and Candidates. 

9 
 
 
The system must allow Recruiters to post jobs, manage applications, and conduct 
assessments. 
 
The system must help recruiters filter and find candidates based on test performance 
and job criteria. 
 
The system must manage the data related to Job Postings, Applications, and 
Assessments. 
 
The system must support real-time email notifications based on application status 
(selected/rejected). 
 
The system must allow editing, updating, and deleting of job posts and user data. 
 
The system should implement role-based access to ensure secure and restricted 
functionality for recruiters and candidates. 
 
It also requires a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access and to ensure 
that user data such as emails, assessment scores, and personal details are protected 
even in the event of a database breach. 
1.4  Traditional  Method VS Modern Approach 
The traditional hiring process relied heavily on manual screening of resumes, shortlisting 
candidates based on qualifications, and conducting multiple rounds of interviews without any 
structured assessment of actual skills. This non-skill-based hiring method had several 
drawbacks. The process of shortlisting candidates based on resumes was time-consuming, 
inconsistent, and often biased. Important details were scattered across emails and 
spreadsheets, and there was no standardized way to evaluate whether a candidate truly 
possessed the required skills for the role. Generating reports, tracking applications, and 
communicating with candidates involved a lot of repetitive tasks and manual effort. 
Furthermore, the absence of assessment tools meant recruiters often relied on assumptions or 
lengthy interviews to judge skills, leading to potential mismatches in hiring.In contrast, the 
modern approach of skill-based hiring, as implemented in the Online Job Portal System, 
automates the entire process. It allows recruiters to assess candidates through customized 
online tests, filter them based on performance, and send real-time email notifications. This 
not only reduces manual workload but also ensures objective, data-driven decisions. The 
system eliminates redundancy, reduces hiring time, and increases accuracy in candidate 
selection by focusing on what truly matters—skills and capabilities.

portal data. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, (8379)[2] 
The paper titled “Online Job Portal” by Pinjari, De, Kokne, Siddiqui, and Chitre (2019), 
published in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, presents the 
design and development of an online platform aimed at simplifying and enhancing the 
recruitment process. The study outlines the challenges faced in traditional hiring methods, 
such as time-consuming procedures, limited reach, and inefficient communication between 
job seekers and employers. To overcome these issues, the authors proposed a web-based 
system where candidates can register, upload resumes, and apply for jobs, while recruiters 
can post job openings and search for suitable profiles. The system emphasizes ease of access, 
real-time interaction, and centralized information management to make the hiring process 
more efficient. The paper highlights the growing need for such digital solutions in the 
recruitment domain and suggests that online job portals can significantly reduce manual 
work, speed up the hiring process, and provide better visibility into job opportunities and 
candidate profiles.

of work engagement: A longitudinal study,” Journal of Vocational Behavior, vol. 70, 
(2007)[3] 
The study by S. Mauno, U. Kinnunen, and M. Ruokolainen (2007), titled “Job Demands and 
Resources as Antecedents of Work Engagement” and published in the Journal of Vocational 
Behavior, explores how job demands and job resources influence employee work engagement 
over time. Through a longitudinal approach, the researchers found that while high job 
demands can lead to stress and burnout, sufficient job resources—such as support from 
colleagues, feedback, and opportunities for growth—significantly boost engagement and 
motivation. The study emphasizes that a balance between demands and resources is crucial 
for sustaining employee well-being and productivity in the workplace

M. Gangle’s 2007 study, “The Only Way Is Up? Employment Protection and Job Mobility 
Among Recent Entrants to European Labour Markets,” published in the European 
Sociological Review, examines how employment protection laws affect job mobility for 
newcomers in European labor markets. The study finds that stricter employment protection 
can limit job mobility, making it harder for recent entrants to move between jobs or advance 
in their careers. While such protections offer job security, they may also unintentionally 
hinder upward mobility for new workers trying to establish themselves professionally.

Management Engineering and Information Technology 2.2 (2015)[5] 
Hada and Swati Gairola's 2015 paper, “Opportunities & Challenges of E-Recruitment,” 
explores how digital platforms have transformed the hiring process. The authors highlight the 
major advantages of e-recruitment, such as cost-effectiveness, wider reach, faster 
communication, and improved candidate matching. However, they also discuss challenges 
like data privacy issues, managing large volumes of applications, and the potential lack of 
personal touch in virtual hiring. The paper concludes that while e-recruitment offers immense 
potential, organizations must address these challenges to fully leverage its benefits

2. CHAPTER  
           FUNCTIONALITIES OF SKILL SPHERE (E-JOB PORTAL) 
 
2.1  Building The Frontend Logic For The Website 
 
This is a breakdown of key points to consider when setting up the frontend logic for 
Online Job Portal System: 
 
1. User Interface (UI) Design: 
 Clear and Intuitive Layout: Designed a user-friendly interface with 
clear navigation and easy-to-understand sections using react which is a 
popular framework of JavaScript 
 Responsive Design: Ensure the system adapts seamlessly to different 
screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) 
 Visually Appealing: Use a consistent colour scheme, typography to 
create a professional and engaging look 
 
2. Core Functionalities: 
 User Registration: Allows both recruiters and candidates to register 
with basic information such as name, email, phone number, and password 
 Recruiter Profile: Enables recruiters to create and manage their profiles, 
including company details, job postings, and assessment configuration 
 Candidate Profile: Allows candidates to create detailed profiles with 
educational qualifications, skill sets, experience, and resume uploads 
 Job Posting: Recruiters can post job openings with relevant details like 
job title, description, required skills, experience level, and salary range 
 Application Management: Candidates can apply to jobs and take 
assessments, recruiters can view submissions, assessment scores, and 
shortlist candidates. 

13 
 
 Real-Time Email Notifications: Sends automated email notifications to 
candidates upon selection or rejection, and updates recruiters on new 
applications 
 Recruiter Approval (Admin Panel): When a recruiter signs up, the 
profile request goes to the admin for verification. Only after approval can 
the recruiter post jobs. An automated email is sent upon profile activation 
 
3.  State Management: 
 Context API for Global State: Used a state management solution to 
efficiently manage and update component states, especially for complex 
interactions 
 Component-Based Architecture: The frontend is structured using 
modular, 
reusable 
components. 
This 
approach 
improves 
code 
maintainability, readability, and makes the UI scalable by allowing 
isolated development of features and easier debugging 
 
 
4. API Integration: 
 REST API: Developed and consumed a REST API to enable smooth 
communication between the frontend and backend. The API handles user 
authentication, job posting, application management, and assessment 
submissions. 
 Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling using try-catch 
blocks in API requests. Errors are caught and displayed to users in real-
time via toast notifications, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly 
experience 
 Data Validation: Performed client-side validation for user inputs (e.g., 
during registration, job posting, and assessment submission) to ensure 
only valid data is sent to the backend, enhancing data quality and reducing 
unnecessary server load 
 
 
 

14 
 
 2.2  Setting Up The backend and the database 
 
1. API Design: 
 Designed REST APIs to manage core functionalities such as user 
authentication, job posting, candidate application, assessment handling, 
and recruiter decision-making 
 Defined clear and modular endpoints for each major operation to 
ensure 
scalability 
and 
maintainability(eg:/api/auth/signup 
for 
Signup,/api/jobs/post for Recruiter job posting,/api/candidates/apply for 
applying) 
 
2. User Authentication and Authorization: 
 Implemented robust authentication mechanisms using built-in 
Express.js features along with libraries like Bcrypt.js for secure password 
hashing and JSON Web Token (JWT) for token-based authentication, 
ensuring secure access to user accounts 
 Implemented role-based authorization to control access across the 
platform. Depending on the role (e.g., Candidate or Recruiter), users get 
a personalized experience — candidates can apply for jobs and take 
assessments, while recruiters can post jobs, view applicants, and make 
hiring decisions. 
 
3. Data Modelling: 
 Designed a clear and efficient database schema to store user information, 
job postings, candidate applications, assessment scores, and recruiter 
decisions 
 Considered using a NoSQL database MongoDB for flexible data 
structures and scalability 
 
 
 

15 
 
4. Assessment Scheduling and Job Application Handling: 
 Implemented a logic-driven flow where candidates can apply for jobs and 
are immediately prompted to take skill-based assessments, ensuring a 
streamlined application process 
 Handled application conflicts by restricting multiple submissions for the 
same job and triggered real-time email notifications to candidates upon 
assessment completion, selection, or rejection by the recruiter. 
 
5. Connecting the database with our application: 
 Established a connection between Mongo DB and the backend server built 
using Express.js, utilizing the Mongoose library for seamless interaction 
with the database. 
 Implemented and integrated four main schemas to structure the data  
effectively: User Schema, Job Schema, Application Schema, Session 
schema 
                
6. Data Validation and Security: 
 Implemented data validation to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid 
input. 
 Used appropriate security measures to protect sensitive user data like 
encryption of password using bcrypt.js, access controls via authtoken 
generated by Json Web token. 
 
 
 
2.3  Connecting The backend with frontend With Native Fetch 
 
1. Fetch function Integration: 
 Established communication between the React frontend and Express.js 
backend using the native fetch() API to send and receive JSON data 
 Configured secure API calls by including JWT tokens in request headers 
and handled responses for actions like user authentication, job posting, 
and application updates

2. Making API Requests: 
 Managed backend URL via environment variables for scalability and 
made all requests to defined REST endpoints seamlessly within frontend 
components and context providers 
 Passed the appropriate API URL and necessary data (e.g., job details, 
application content, status) as arguments to perform secure and structured 
HTTP requests. 
 
 
3. Error Handling: 
 Used the try catch block method to handle errors that may occur during 
API requests 
 Logged errors to the console for debugging and displayed user-friendly 
error messages on the frontend during an invalid input 
 
4. Asynchronous Operations: 
 Used async/await syntax to make API requests asynchronously, 
preventing blocking of the user interface. Async function ensures that a 
function will return promise and await ensures that function will move 
ahead only when promise is resolved 
 Handle loading states and error states appropriately using loading 
indicators and error messages 
 
5. Security Considerations: 
 Implemented token-based authentication using JWT to secure user 
sessions and protect access to restricted routes based on user roles 
(candidate, recruiter, admin) 
 Validated user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent injection 
attacks and ensure data integrity 
 Used secure HTTP headers and CORS configurations to safeguard data 
transmission and backend APIs.
